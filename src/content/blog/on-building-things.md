There's a particular satisfaction in building something that works well. Not just functionally correct, but *well* — where the pieces fit together cleanly and the whole thing feels right.

## The gap between working and good

Most software works. It compiles, it passes tests, it ships. But there's a wide gap between "it works" and "it's good." The difference lives in the details: naming, structure, the way modules talk to each other, how errors surface.

Good software is considerate. It considers the next person who'll read the code, the user who'll encounter an edge case, the future self who'll need to change something six months from now.

## Process as practice

I've come to believe the *how* matters almost as much as the *what*. Not in a dogmatic "follow this methodology" way, but in the sense that the habits you build while making things shape the things you make.

> The way you do anything is the way you do everything.

Taking time to think before coding. Writing things down. Reviewing your own work before asking others to. These small practices compound.

## Shipping still wins

That said — shipping beats perfection. Every time. The best code is code that exists and solves a problem. You can always refactor later, but you can't refactor something that was never built.

The trick is finding the balance: good enough to ship, thoughtful enough to maintain.
