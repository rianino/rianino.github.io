This is the first post on this site. I've been meaning to carve out a space to think out loud for a while now, and here it is.

I plan to write about building things, the tools I reach for, and whatever else catches my attention. No schedule, no pressure — just a place to put thoughts down.

## Why write?

Writing forces clarity. When an idea only lives in your head it can feel complete, but putting it into words exposes the gaps. I want more of that.

## What to expect

Short-form posts, mostly. Some technical, some not. I'll try to keep things honest and avoid filler.

Thanks for reading.
