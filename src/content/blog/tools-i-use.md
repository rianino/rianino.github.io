I like keeping my setup simple. Here's what I'm currently using day-to-day.

## Editor

**VS Code** with a minimal set of extensions. I've tried the Vim-only life and the full IDE life — VS Code hits the sweet spot for me. Fast enough, extensible enough, gets out of the way.

## Terminal

**Windows Terminal** with **WSL2** running Ubuntu. Having a real Linux environment without dual-booting is one of those things that sounds too good to be true, but it works remarkably well.

## Languages

Mostly **TypeScript** these days. Python when I need it. Rust when I'm feeling ambitious.

## Version control

**Git** on the command line. I've never found a GUI that's faster than knowing the commands. `git log --oneline --graph` is all the visualization I need.

## Writing

Markdown in the editor, same as code. I don't want a separate tool for writing — it adds friction and breaks the flow.

## Philosophy

The best tool is the one you know well. Switching tools constantly has a real cost. Pick something reasonable, learn it deeply, and only switch when the pain of staying outweighs the cost of moving.
