Heya! Welcome to my blog. It’s an honour to have you!

 

I’m very stoked that this is finally working.

  
At the time of this writing, I just built the first part of the backend of this website - I’m using Notion’s API to connect the database where I’m writing these blog posts to my website. That way I can just come on to Notion and write my ideas as I normally would, and they’ll automatically be published!

 

I find that amazing. 

 

It means people get to read what I write for myself - making my blog the place where I expose my thoughts. In the future I would like to implement a rating and comment system so that you can criticize my thoughts, and I can then fix them up! That’s the whole point of publicising for me. I don’t want anything else other than to share ideas so that mine and the readers’ reasoning can be better.

 

Why not post on X or Reddit or Quora then? I post on X, in shorter format, check it out! [@rianvilares](http://x.com/rianvilares)
